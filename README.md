# broverette-explorer
broverette_explorer is a ROS 2 Humble package that combines slam_toolbox, Nav2, explorer_lite, and broverette_core to provide end-to-end autonomous exploration for the Broverette platform. It builds a 2D map, identifies frontiers, and drives the robot to explore unknown environments with minimal configuration.
